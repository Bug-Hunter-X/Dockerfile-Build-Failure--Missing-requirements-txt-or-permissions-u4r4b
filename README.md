This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: failure to build due to issues with the `requirements.txt` file or insufficient permissions. The original Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) attempts to install Python dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, but it might fail if the `requirements.txt` file is missing, has incorrect paths, or if the user lacks permissions. The solution (`Dockerfile_fixed`) addresses these potential issues by providing a `requirements.txt` file, adding explicit permission handling for the `RUN` commands, and including robust error handling.
